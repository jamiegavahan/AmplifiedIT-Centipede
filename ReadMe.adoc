Centipede is a free, self-serve* solution supported by Amplified Labs that packages together an inexpensive microcontroller 
with a step-by-step instruction guide and all the necessary starter code.

With the physical device and a free Arduino Create account, you have the ability to program the device to use your own settings for 
WiFi and enrollment credentials, and it will enroll a device for you. The device acts exactly if it were a keyboard, executing programmed commands.
